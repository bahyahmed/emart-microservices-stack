## Architecture Overview

This project includes:

- **Angular (Client)** â€“ Frontend single-page application.
- **Node.js (Emart API)** â€“ Handles main business logic and connects to MongoDB.
- **Java Spring Boot (Books API)** â€“ Manages book-related endpoints, connected to MySQL.
- **MongoDB** â€“ Used by Node.js API to store Emart data.
- **MySQL** â€“ Used by Java API to store book data.
- **Nginx** â€“ Acts as an API Gateway, reverse proxies requests to the correct backend services.

All services are containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose.
