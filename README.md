# EMart Microservices Stack

This repository contains the full Dockerized microservices architecture for the **EMart App**, an e-commerce-style project built using multiple technologies and containerized for deployment.

## Architecture Overview

This project includes:

- **Angular (Client)** – Frontend single-page application.
- **Node.js (Emart API)** – Handles main business logic and connects to MongoDB.
- **Java Spring Boot (Books API)** – Manages book-related endpoints, connected to MySQL.
- **MongoDB** – Used by Node.js API to store Emart data.
- **MySQL** – Used by Java API to store book data.
- **Nginx** – Acts as an API Gateway, reverse proxies requests to the correct backend services.

All services are containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose.
